I was going to update these on there eggs github but they closed as ready only now so here is them offically working release not Alpha anymore.

You will need to change these with your settings for ports and etc.

UT99: "UnrealTourament.ini"

UT2004: "ut2004.ini" for 2004.

I will upload those as well on here. Have fun kicking back to some good old UT.
